Lydia and the earliest coins

According to the Greek historian Herodotus, writing in the fifth century BC, the Lydians were the first people to have used gold and silver coinage.
He was almost correct. The earliest coins are found mainly in the parts of modern Turkey that formed the ancient kingdom of Lydia, but are made from a naturally occurring mixture of gold and silver called electrum.
These coins were first produced in the seventh century BC and had a design on one side only;
the other was marked with simple punches.
